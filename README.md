# Energy Consumption Forecasting in Greater Sydney

This project uses machine learning techniques to forecast electricity consumption in the Greater Sydney Region. It incorporates factors such as temperature, humidity, solar usage, holidays, and time of day to build predictive models.

## Project Goals

- Analyse historical electricity consumption data.
- Explore the impact of environmental and temporal factors.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models for energy demand forecasting.
- Visualise patterns and predictions to support smarter energy decisions.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Git, GitHub
